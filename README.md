# **WaveTracer**
**A reverb generator based on ray tracing technologies by Nino Saglia, Jonar Verbart and Wouter M. Besse**

Welcome to our project, we've got many files around here. Some of them more interesting than the others.
To find our final result, go to folder `Full Project`

A video of the project working can be found here: https://youtu.be/H8jKapgd9Y8

Most important files are makeable as a simple CMake project.
We used the portaudio audio engine to run most of our work.

In the WaveTracer you can move around in a 3D space. From your position, live ray tracing technology will be used to generate a delay list which will then be used by the reverb.
